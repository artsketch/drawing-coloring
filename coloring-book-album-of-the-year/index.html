But Ill go back to the album itself although Coloring Book won the Grammy for rap album of the year to classify it as any one genre would be limiting. This record will remain a true genre-bending masterpiece for years to come.</p>

<p>Nonetheless Coloring Book is nominated for Best Rap Album. Ad New Customers get Free Delivery on Their First Eligible Order. It almost runs like a Thom Yorke solo project song minus Thom Yorke of course and add in some 30 year old post-hardcore veterans on the quest for new territory. Chance The Rapper struggles to find a balance between the ends and the means on his new mixtape Coloring Book. Officeworks helping you make bigger things happen. Coloring Book is a really nice step forward for Chance I do think that this album does still have some weak moments and goes on for way too long with a weaker second half but I do think there is some enjoyment to be had here and still leaves me with hope that perhaps Chance has it in him to make a remarkable project.
