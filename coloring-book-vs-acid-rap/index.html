I think Coloring Book was the manifestation of the closest weve seen to Chances full potential and I think its more cohesive and thematic as an album. Theyre drastically different so its hard to compare them but I still think Acid Rap is a masterpiece of a mixtape thats hard to top even for chance. 7 points 1 year ago.

<p>Not only does Chance have the honour of being one of the few independent artists to ever win a Grammy he also made history with Coloring Book becoming the first streaming-only album. People on here are hating on the gospel aspects but I think thats really what gave Coloring Book its own sound vibe. With nothing but mixtapes in his discography he was still popular enough to be a featured artist at Lollapalooza 2013. The 2013 mixtape outpaced coloring book in its debut. Some days I like it more than Acid Rap it depends on my mood. Do you need a Record Deal in 2021. Awesome Acid Cartoon Wallpapers Wallpaperaccess.</p>
